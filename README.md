# Rocket Pool Rewards Trees
This repository contains the Merkle Tree files used by Rocket Pool node operators when claiming RPL and Smoothing Pool rewards using [the new Redstone rewards system](https://github.com/rocket-pool/rocketpool-research/tree/master/Merkle%20Rewards%20System).
If you cannot download them from IPFS on your node because of ISP or router restrictions, or are simply interested in doing analytics on them, you can retrieve them from here.

The content is the same as what is hosted on IPFS, but it has been decompressed and formatted for ease of readability.
